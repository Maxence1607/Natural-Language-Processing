# Natural-Language-Processing

This is my github repository for Natural Language Processing. 

* It covers a variety of NLP approaches and concepts, including the basics such as lemmatising or bag of words, to word embeddings, and then in terms of modelling it covers Hidden Markov Models and finally neural network based models.

* The final project was to design a simple chatbot that could either answer technical questions (by replying with a relevant answer from stack overflow, or could just chit chat. The network itself was implemented in Tensorflow following a character level seq2seq approach.
